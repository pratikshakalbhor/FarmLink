Rice Supply Chain Smart Contract
Description
The Rice Supply Chain Smart Contract is a blockchain-based solution built on the Move programming language that enables transparent and traceable management of rice batches throughout the agricultural supply chain. This smart contract allows farmers to create rice batches and securely transfer ownership to distributors, retailers, and other stakeholders while maintaining complete traceability from farm to consumer.
The contract implements a simple yet effective system for tracking rice batches with unique identifiers, quantity measurements, origin farm information, and transfer history. Each rice batch is represented as a digital asset that can be safely transferred between verified parties while preserving the complete chain of custody.
Vision
Our vision is to revolutionize the agricultural supply chain by leveraging blockchain technology to create a transparent, secure, and efficient system for tracking food products from farm to table. We aim to:

Enhance Food Safety: Provide complete traceability of rice batches to quickly identify and isolate contaminated products
Build Consumer Trust: Enable consumers to verify the origin and journey of their food products
Empower Farmers: Give farmers direct access to supply chain data and fair compensation tracking
Reduce Food Fraud: Create an immutable record that prevents counterfeit products from entering the supply chain
Support Sustainability: Enable tracking of sustainable farming practices and environmental impact
Facilitate Compliance: Help agricultural businesses meet regulatory requirements for food traceability

Future Scope
The Rice Supply Chain Smart Contract serves as a foundation for a comprehensive agricultural blockchain ecosystem. Future enhancements and expansions include:

# Rice Supply Chain Tracking Smart Contract

## Description

The Rice Supply Chain Tracking smart contract is a blockchain-based solution built on the Aptos network that provides transparent, immutable tracking of rice batches from farm to consumer. This decentralized system ensures food safety, authenticity, and traceability throughout the entire supply chain process.

The contract enables farmers to create rice batches with unique identifiers and allows secure transfer of ownership between supply chain participants including distributors, processors, retailers, and consumers. Each batch maintains complete traceability data including origin farm, current owner, quantity, and transfer history, creating an unalterable record that enhances food safety and reduces fraud.

Key features include batch creation with unique identifiers, secure ownership transfers with permission verification, complete traceability from farm to table, and immutable transfer count tracking for supply chain transparency.

## Vision

Our vision is to transform the agricultural supply chain by creating a transparent, trustworthy, and efficient rice tracking ecosystem that:

- **Ensures Food Safety**: Complete traceability from farm to consumer table for rapid contamination source identification
- **Prevents Food Fraud**: Immutable blockchain records eliminate counterfeit rice and false origin claims
- **Empowers Consumers**: Transparent access to rice origin, journey, and quality information
- **Supports Farmers**: Direct connection to consumers with verified organic and premium rice certification
- **Reduces Waste**: Efficient supply chain management through real-time batch tracking and inventory management
- **Builds Trust**: Transparent, verifiable supply chain that enhances confidence in food products

## Future Scope

### Short-term Enhancements
